# Active Context

## Current Focus

Improving build system and developer experience:
- Added comprehensive build prerequisites check script
- Enhanced documentation for Windows development setup
- Streamlined Visual Studio toolchain detection
- Fixed and improved Makefile targets
- Added robust process management for builds

## Recent Changes

1. Added `check-prerequisites.ps1`:
   - Validates all required build dependencies
   - Provides clear installation instructions
   - Handles Visual Studio environment setup
   - Checks HWiNFO configuration

2. Updated documentation:
   - Expanded build prerequisites in `techContext.md`
   - Added detailed environment setup steps
   - Documented development tools and IDE support

3. Improved Makefile:
   - Added standard `build` target (aliases to `plugin`)
   - Removed external repository dependencies
   - Added proper `.PHONY` declarations
   - Added `clean` target
   - Improved directory handling
   - Made `release` depend on `build`
   - Added automatic creation of necessary directories
   - Added process management to prevent sharing violations
   - Improved error handling for process termination

## Next Steps

1. Build System:
   - Test build process with verified prerequisites
   - Consider automating HWiNFO configuration check in build scripts
   - Add CI pipeline configuration
   - Consider adding process management to install-plugin.bat

2. Documentation:
   - Add troubleshooting guide for common build issues
   - Document release process and versioning
   - Add development workflow examples
   - Document process management in build system

## Active Decisions

1. Build Prerequisites:
   - Minimum Go version set to 1.22+
   - VS2022 Build Tools preferred over full VS installation
   - PowerShell 7 recommended but not required
   - protoc auto-downloaded when needed

2. Development Environment:
   - Windows-first development approach
   - Automated toolchain detection and setup
   - Clear separation of required vs optional components
   - Robust process management during builds

3. Build System:
   - Standard target names (`build`, `clean`, `release`)
   - Self-contained build process without external dependencies
   - Automatic directory creation for build artifacts
   - Fail-safe cleanup operations
   - Process termination before file operations
   - Silent error handling for non-critical operations

## Current Challenges

1. Build Environment:
   - Visual Studio environment setup complexity
   - HWiNFO shared memory configuration requirements
   - Cross-compilation considerations
   - Process management during builds

2. Documentation:
   - Keeping setup instructions current
   - Balancing detail vs clarity
   - Supporting different VS2022 editions
   - Explaining build process management

## Notes

- The `check-prerequisites.ps1` script should be run before any build attempts
- HWiNFO must be properly configured for development testing
- Visual Studio Build Tools installation might need manual component selection
- Consider adding version checks to Makefile targets
- Build process is now self-contained and doesn't require external repositories
- Build system automatically handles process termination
- Stream Deck and plugin processes are terminated before builds
