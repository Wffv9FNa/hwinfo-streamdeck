# Active Context

## Current Focus

Improving HWiNFO integration and stability:
- Fixed shared memory access with retry mechanism
- Added proper signature validation
- Improved process management and monitoring
- Enhanced error handling and logging
- Added resource cleanup
- Updated system patterns documentation
- Fixed plugin stability issues

## Recent Changes

1. Fixed HWiNFO shared memory access:
   - Added retry mechanism (5 retries with 1-second delays)
   - Implemented proper signature validation
   - Added "DEAD" signature detection
   - Improved mutex handling
   - Enhanced error messages
   - Added debug logging
   - Fixed resource cleanup

2. Improved plugin process management:
   - Removed winpeg dependency
   - Added auto-restart capability
   - Improved error handling
   - Added process monitoring
   - Enhanced resource cleanup
   - Fixed type errors with ProcessExitGroup

3. Updated documentation:
   - Added HWiNFO integration patterns
   - Documented shared memory access patterns
   - Added process management patterns
   - Updated system patterns
   - Added error handling patterns

4. Enhanced error handling:
   - Added detailed error messages
   - Improved error context
   - Added debug logging
   - Better resource management
   - Proper cleanup on errors

## Current Issues

1. User Experience:
   - Need better UI feedback during initialization
   - Configuration changes not reflected immediately
   - Error messages could be more user-friendly
   - No configuration persistence

2. Build Process:
   - Process termination could be more robust
   - Some file operations may fail due to timing
   - Visual Studio detection needs improvement
   - HWiNFO verification not integrated with main build

## Next Steps

1. Integration:
   - Add configuration persistence
   - Improve UI feedback
   - Add automatic configuration where possible
   - Integrate verification into build process

2. Documentation:
   - Add troubleshooting guide for common issues
   - Document configuration requirements
   - Update build documentation
   - Add development workflow examples

3. Testing:
   - Add automated tests
   - Test different configurations
   - Validate error handling
   - Test process management

## Active Decisions

1. HWiNFO Integration:
   - Use retry mechanism for shared memory access
   - Validate signatures before data access
   - Monitor process state
   - Clean up resources properly
   - Provide detailed error context

2. Development Workflow:
   - Validate environment before builds
   - Check HWiNFO configuration automatically
   - Manage process lifecycle during builds
   - Support both development and release builds
   - Organize tooling scripts consistently

## Current Challenges

1. User Experience:
   - Real-time configuration updates
   - Error message clarity
   - Configuration persistence
   - Initialization feedback

2. Documentation:
   - Keeping setup instructions current
   - Balancing detail vs clarity
   - Supporting different VS2022 editions
   - Explaining build process management
   - Improving HWiNFO setup guidance

## Notes

- The plugin now properly handles HWiNFO shared memory access
- Retry mechanism helps with timing issues during initialization
- Process monitoring ensures plugin stability
- Resource cleanup prevents memory leaks
- Error handling provides better context for troubleshooting
- Configuration persistence needs to be implemented
- UI feedback during initialization could be improved
- Real-time configuration updates would enhance user experience
