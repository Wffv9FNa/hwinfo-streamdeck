# Progress

## What Works

- Core sensor reading from HWiNFO shared memory (`internal/hwinfo`):
  - Robust shared memory access with retries
  - Proper signature validation
  - Detailed error handling
  - Clean resource management
- Stream Deck action plumbing that handles events (`internal/app/hwinfostreamdeckplugin`):
  - Improved process management
  - Auto-restart capability
  - Better error logging
  - Clean resource cleanup
- Build system improvements:
  - Prerequisites validation script
  - Improved Makefile targets
  - Visual Studio environment setup
  - Self-contained build process
  - Process management and sharing violation prevention
  - Silent error handling for process termination
- HWiNFO integration:
  - Installation verification
  - Configuration validation
  - Shared memory testing with retries
  - Mode detection
  - Detailed error reporting
  - Proper signature validation
  - Resource cleanup

## Current Status

Development environment setup phase:
- Build prerequisites script completed
- Makefile improvements implemented
- Documentation updated
- Process management implemented
- Ready for feature development
- HWiNFO integration working:
  - ✅ Sensor loading fixed
  - ✅ Shared memory access working
  - ✅ Configuration requirements validated
  - ✅ Proper error handling implemented

## Known Issues

1. HWiNFO Configuration:
   - No clear error message in UI for configuration issues
   - Sensor list doesn't update when configuration changes
   - No automatic recovery from configuration changes

2. Build Process:
   - Process termination could be more robust
   - Some file operations may fail due to timing
   - Visual Studio detection needs improvement
   - HWiNFO verification not integrated with main build

3. Development Experience:
   - Manual steps still required for some setup
   - Configuration validation spread across multiple places
   - Limited automated testing
