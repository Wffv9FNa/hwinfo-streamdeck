# Progress

## What Works

- Core sensor reading from HWiNFO shared memory (`internal/hwinfo`).
- Stream Deck action plumbing that handles events (`internal/app/hwinfostreamdeckplugin`).
- Build system improvements:
  - Prerequisites validation script
  - Improved Makefile targets
  - Visual Studio environment setup
  - Self-contained build process

## What's Left to Build / Improve

1. Build System:
   - CI pipeline setup
   - Automated testing in CI
   - Version stamping automation
   - Code signing workflow

2. Documentation:
   - Troubleshooting guide
   - Common build issues
   - Development workflow examples

3. Features:
   - Enhanced configuration UI (Property Inspector)
   - Robust error handling when HWiNFO is not running
   - Unit tests and CI pipeline
   - Documentation & release packaging

## Current Status

Development environment setup phase:
- Build prerequisites script completed
- Makefile improvements implemented
- Documentation updated
- Ready for feature development

## Known Issues

1. Build Environment:
   - External repository dependency removed (needs testing)
   - HWiNFO shared memory configuration must be manual

2. Runtime:
   - Race conditions on shutdown occasionally hold HWiNFO mutex
   - UI assets require retina scaling adjustments

## Recent Milestones

1. Build System:
   - ✅ Prerequisites check script
   - ✅ VS2022 environment setup
   - ✅ Makefile improvements
   - ✅ Self-contained build process

2. Documentation:
   - ✅ Build prerequisites
   - ✅ Environment setup
   - ✅ Build patterns
   - ✅ Development workflow

## Next Milestones

1. Short-term:
   - Test build process on clean machine
   - Add common troubleshooting solutions
   - Implement version stamping

2. Medium-term:
   - Set up CI pipeline
   - Add automated tests
   - Implement code signing
